## Greedy algorithms

**Greedy property** - at that exact moment , what is the optimal choice to make ?

Greedy don't guaranteee solutions but make efficient use of time\

Greedy usage:
1. They are fast (comparing with D&C and dynamic programming)
2. Sometimes they give optimal solution (Dijkstra's Algorithm)
