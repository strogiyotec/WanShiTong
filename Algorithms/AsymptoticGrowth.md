# Asymptotic Order of growth

Our ability to express an algorithms's worst-case on input of size **N** at a rate which is proportional to some function **f(n)** 

Let's say algortihms runs at most `3n^2 + 3n + 8`  

**Problems**
- in order to determine it we have to spend a lot of time.
- Some algortihms implementations could have different constant factors

That is why we want to express the growth rate in a way which is insensitive to constant factors.
