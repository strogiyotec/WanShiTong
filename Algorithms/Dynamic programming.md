## Dynamic programming
**Definition** - solving complex problem by breaking it into multiple simple problems\
solve each of them independently, store result of each problem\

## Steps
1. Characterize the structure of an optimal solution
2. Recursive define the value of an optimal solution
3. Compute the value of an optimal solution typically in a bottom up fashion
4. Construct an optimal solution from computed information

General rule\
> If algorithms can be solved be 2^n time
> then it could be solved using dynamic programming

## Memoization
Split task into sub tasks and keep result.
