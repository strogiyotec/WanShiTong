# Glossary

- **Leaf Node** - node without children
- **Sibling** - children of the same parent
- **Edge** - edge connects two nodes. Every node is connected by exactly one incoming edge. Node can have multiple outcoming edges
- **Level**(depth) - the number of edges from the root to given node.
- **Height** - The longest path from root to leaf
- **Internal node** - node with at least one child
- **Ancestor** - Parent of the node
- **Descendant** - Everyone except for the root
- **Predecessor** - The biggest element in left child (the most right element in left child)
- **Successor** - The smallest element in right child(the most left element in right child) 
    - successor of node x is a node with smallest key bigger than **x.key**
