## Cassandra

### Distributed
Cassandra is distributed. Capable of running on multiple machines. All notes function the same. No single point of failure

### CAP theorem
**C** - Consistency - all database clients will read the same value for the same query\
**A** - Availability - all database clients will always be able to read and write\
**P** - Partition tolerance - the DB can be split into multiple machines\	

Cassandra is AP which means it's always available and supportpartitioning\
But Data is not always consistent
