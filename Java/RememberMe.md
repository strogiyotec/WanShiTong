# HashMap
1. Initial capacity - the initial length of array of backets
2. Load factor how big map is allowed to be before resizing
### Example
1. Load factor - 0.75
2. Capacity - 16\
**16*0.75 = 12**\
So when capacity is equals to 12+1 => map increase capacity to 16*2 = 32

> When hashmap resizes then each hash for each key is recalculated
