How Firefox Lost the war. 300 out of 500 people who visited my blog are using Chrome, other Major browsers in use are Safari Edge and Lastly Firefox with 10 users.
I am a big fun of Firefox browser and Mozilla corporation in general and seeing how my favorite browser is  lossing  thpusdands people every month makes me sad not only because Firefox can lose a development team under it but mostly because Internet browser mowadays become monopolized.
First of all, I have nothing against of Chrome, it's a great and high performant browser which I used all the time up until I switched to Linux with pre-installed Firefox. Chrome opensourced it's engine called Blink , what is more, other popular browsers such as Edge,Brave,Vivalde are based on this , but not a Firefox, Firefox has it's own called Gecko.
